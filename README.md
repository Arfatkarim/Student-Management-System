# Student Management System

A Java-based desktop application built with Swing to manage student records efficiently. I created this for my 5th-semester project at Daffodil Institute of IT, and I’m super proud of its sleek GUI and smooth functionality!

 Features
- Add Students: Enter details like name, roll, ID, email, CGPA, course, and more.
- Update Records: Edit selected student details easily.
- Remove Students: Delete records with a confirmation prompt.
- Sort by Name: Organize the student list alphabetically.
- Clear Fields: Reset input fields for quick data entry.
- Stylish GUI: Uses Deep Teal, Off-White, and Coral colors with Roboto font for a professional look.
- Status Feedback: Shows messages like “Student added!” that auto-clear after 4 seconds.
- Developer Links: Clickable GitHub, LinkedIn, and portfolio links in the header.
